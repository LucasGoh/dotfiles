Folding methods
To activate folding in your text, you will need to set the 'foldmethod' option.

The 'foldmethod' option (abbreviated to 'fdm') is local to each window. It determines what kind of folding applies in the current window. Possible values are:

manual – folds must be defined by entering commands (such as zf)
indent – groups of lines with the same indent form a fold
syntax – folds are defined by syntax highlighting
expr – folds are defined by a user-defined expression
marker – special characters can be manually or automatically added to your text to flag the start and end of folds
diff – used to fold unchanged text when viewing differences (automatically set in diff mode)
Manual folding
Normally it is best to use an automatic folding method, but manual folding is simple and can be useful for dealing with small folds.

When foldmethod is set to manual (or marker), a fold can be created in Normal mode by typing zf{motion}. For example, zf'a will fold from the current line to wherever the mark a has been set, or zf3j folds the current line along with the following 3 lines. If you want to create folds in a text file that uses curly braces to delimit code blocks ({...}), you can use the command zfa} to create a fold for the current code block.

Alternatively, an arbitrary group of lines can be folded by selecting them to enter Visual mode and pressing zf. This allows you to preview the section you've selected before you fold it. The above example of folding the current code block could also be accomplished by first selecting the code block delimited by the curly braces (va}) and then creating the fold (zf). Putting this together gives va}zf.
